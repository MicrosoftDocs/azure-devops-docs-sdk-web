      Specify the strategy used to merge the pull request during completion. If
      MergeStrategy is not set to any value, a no-FF merge will be created if
      SquashMerge == false. If MergeStrategy is not set to any value, the pull
      request commits will be squash if SquashMerge == true. The SquashMerge
      member is deprecated. It is recommended that you explicitly set
      MergeStrategy in all cases. If an explicit value is provided for
      MergeStrategy, the SquashMerge member will be ignored.

      MergeStrategy. If MergeStrategy is set to any value, the SquashMerge value
      will be ignored. If MergeStrategy is not set, the merge strategy will be
      no-fast-forward if this flag is false, or squash if true.

      Used by the indentation based strategy to decide wheter empty lines belong
      to the previous or the next block.

      A language adheres to the off-side rule if blocks in that language are
      expressed by their indentation.

      See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule) for more
      information.

      If not set, `false` is used and empty lines belong to the previous block.

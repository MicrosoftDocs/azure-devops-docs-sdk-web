      ForceRepoSecretScanning will be set to true when Enabled, false when
      Disabled, and null when not set. \<br /\> If GHAzDO is NOT already
      enabled, behavior will depend on if GHAzDO is to be enabled/disabled.
      ForceRepoSecretScanning will not affect anything in this scenario. \<br
      /\> If GHAzDO is to be disabled, the value of ForceRepoSecretScan will
      have no effect. \<br /\> If GHAzDO is to be enabled for the first time on
      a repo, then ForceRepoSecretScanning will have no effect. \<br /\> If
      GHAzDO is to be enabled and the repo is already enabled, then
      ForceRepoSecretScanning will force the secret scanning job to be run if it
      is set to true. \<br /\> In all cases where ForceRepoSecretScanning is not
      expected to affect behavior, it will be set to false before being sent to
      Tfs.

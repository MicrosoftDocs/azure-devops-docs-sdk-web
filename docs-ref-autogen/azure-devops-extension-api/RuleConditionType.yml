      This condition checks if current user is member of a particular group.
      This condition does not have any 1:1 mapping with any server side rule
      condition, rather this is a dummy condition added for customer simplicity
      of understanding. This condition is later translated to a FOR membership
      filter . e.g. If the condition is : WhenCurrentUserIsMemberOfGroup
      "Approvers" then "MakeRequired" Field1.Here it translates to a For rule ,
      "MakeRequired" for "Approvers"
    numericValue: 11

      "MakeRequired" not "Approvers"
